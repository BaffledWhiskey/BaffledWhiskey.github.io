<p>Since the release of the NHS Covid-19 app the internet has (as per ususal) been awash with ridiculous conspiracies questioning itâ€™s privacy and integrity. With the UK in the midst of a second wave it is crucial we all play our part to bring the cases back down and prevent more unnecceary deaths and attempt to salvage whatâ€™s left of the economy. This article aims to dispel a few of the concerns you might have about the app and to explain a bit about how it works.</p>

<p>First things first, how does it work? The app uses something called the <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/" target="_blank">Exposure Notification System</a> which is an API written by both Google and Apple to securely track and trace those who have come into contact with a positive case. An API is simply a piece of software that is designed to be used by other devolopers in order to achieve a specific goal (such as tracking cases). This means that the bulk of the functionality for the app comes from the <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/" target="_blank">Exposure Notification System</a> and very little is handled by the app itself.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/" target="_blank">Exposure Notification System</a> maintains your privacy in a couple of ways. Firstly it does not track your location, you read correctly, no GPS tracking. In fact, at the top of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/exposure-notifications/exposure-notifications-api#architecture:~:text=your%20app%20doesn't%20require%20and%20can't%20include%20ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION%2C%20ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" target="_blank">documentation</a> it is clearly stated that you donâ€™t need to and cannot track neither vague or specific location in order to have a working app. Instead the system uses bluetooth to record anonymous IDâ€™s of phones running the same software that have come into close contact with you. The IDâ€™s change every few minutes and are not tied to you in any way, this means that the app can know your phone was near enough another phone for you to be at risk if they end up being a positive case. However, it cannot know where both those phones were, who owns either phone or anything at all about you.</p>

<p>As you go about your daily life using the new NHS app your phone will be silently collecting anaoymous IDâ€™s from other phones within range. It will calculate a risk value based upon the strength of bluetooth signals and determine if you pass a certain threshold to count you as a close contact of another ID (notice how I donâ€™t say person since the app doesnâ€™t know who you are).</p>
