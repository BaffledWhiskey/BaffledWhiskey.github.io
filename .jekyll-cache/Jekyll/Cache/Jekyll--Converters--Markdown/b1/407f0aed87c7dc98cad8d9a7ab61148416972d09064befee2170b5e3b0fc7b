I"Î,<p>For anyone unaware, this is part 2 in an introductory series in the basics of programming - if you haven‚Äôt already I‚Äôd strongly reccomend <a href="../anyoneCanCodeSetupAndVariables">going back and reading the previous blog post here</a>‚Ä¶
For the rest of you, let us continue.</p>

<p>Today we will be tackling the basics of logic, enough for you to be able to understand branch instructions in programming. Logic is a fairly deep topic that trips a lot of us up, I am not intending to explain this philosophically - that would take far too long. Instead I intend to explain it from a computer science perspective but as simply as possible.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Logic for Computers</h4>

<p>Computers are fundamentally logic machines, they deal entirely in 1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs (otherwise interpreted as Trues and Falses). That is to say that <code>1 == True</code> and <code>0 == False</code> (I will explain my use of double equals later - for now it means: the same as). In order to make something capable of doing anything with these two very basic things (True and False), we must have operators over these things that allow us to manipulate them. What is an operator? An operator in the logical context is exactly the same as an operator for a number, the number operators are: + = &amp;times &amp;divide etc. These operators are binary - that is they affect two numbers at once (you may be able to write the sum 1+2+3 but thats technically (1+2)+3 i.e. you add 1 and 2 first and then add that result to 3).</p>

<p>Ok now you understand what an operator is, I can tell you what some of the logical operators are. You will only need 3 to do every logical operation possible - there are more but they‚Äôre essentially just there for easy reading and are not needed for this guide. The ones we are interested in are AND, OR, and NOT, these each do different things to our Trues and Falses.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>AND</h4>

<p>AND gives the result True only if both values surrounding it are True (the values surrounding it are whats called the inputs - so for the sum: 1 + 2 the inputs to the operator ‚Äú+‚Äù would be ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù). An example of this would be:</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>True AND True</code>
<samp>True</samp>

<code>True AND False</code>
<samp>False</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Try heading to <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" target="_blank">IPython</a> again and messing around with True and False. Before you go however I‚Äôll need to tell you how to do this in Python. In Python you must type True exactly like I just have, i.e. it must have a capital T, False must also have a capital F. Furthermore, in this guide I have and will continue to capitalise AND, OR, and NOT to distinguish them from the regular words, in Python you simply write these in the lower case. So for the first example above you would write <code>True and True</code> instead, hopefully that‚Äôs clear. If you manage to get any of that wrong Python will give you a syntax error(basically a wording/grammar error for computers).</p>

<p>Back? Ok, hopefully you managed to replicate my examples above and get the same results. Don‚Äôt worry if you accidentally put in a string or integer instead of True or False and got some unexpected results. Python can also use AND, OR, and NOT on many other data types but that is beyond the scope of this guide.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>OR</h4>

<p>OR gives the result True if either of the two inputs is True, i.e. it only ever gives False if both inputs are False, think of it like the opposite of AND. Again, examples below:</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>True OR True</code>
<samp>True</samp>
    
<code>True OR False</code>
<samp>True</samp>

<code>False OR False</code>
<samp>False</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Again, I‚Äôd recommend heading back to <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" target="_blank">IPython</a> to try out these examples for yourself, remember what I said earlier however.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>NOT</h4>

<p>NOT is slightly different as it only takes one input (not binary like AND and OR). It simply inverts its single input, so if you applied it to True it would give you False and if you applied it to False it would give you True. I can only show two examples here so I might as well show both:</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>NOT True</code>
<samp>False</samp>

<code>NOT False</code>
<samp>True</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Once again, try this in <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" target="_blank">IPython</a> remembering what I said before in the AND section.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Combining Logical Operators</h4>

<p>As you might have guessed you can combine these operators to create more complex logic, remember BIDMAS? Just a quick refresher, BIDMAS is the precedence of the mathematical operators - this simply means their priority. If you had the sum <code>1 + 2 &amp;times 3</code> then you‚Äôd have to multiply 2 and 3 together first and then add the 1, even though the section of the sum <code>1 + 2</code> is furthest to the left. The precedence of the logical operators we have talked about (AND, OR, and NOT) is in the order NOT ‚Üí AND ‚Üí OR (with NOT having the highest priority and OR having the lowest). I‚Äôll put a couple of examples below (with workings):</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>NOT True OR True AND True</code>
<code>False OR True AND True</code>
<code>False OR True</code>
<samp>True</samp>
    
<code>NOT False AND NOT False OR False</code>
<code>True AND True OR False</code>
<code>True OR False</code>
<samp>True</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve dealt with logic we can move on to branching instructions, be sure to go back and refresh this if you get stuck later.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Branching Instructions</h4>

<p>A branch instruction is pretty self explanatory, it is an instruction (a bit like a step in a cook-book recipe) that can take the program execution down a different path (or determine which set of cook book instructions you take). There are a few types, however I will cover If and Else statements here.</p>

<p>An If statement only executes the code within its body (something‚Äôs body means its contents) if its condition is True, see why we did logic first? So for example you could have the code:</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>if True:
    print("This should print")
</code>
<samp>This should print</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Notice the ‚Äúprint‚Äù in the code above? That‚Äôs a function (these will be explained in a later post) that puts the text within it onto the screen. You can try typing this into <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" target="_blank">IPython</a>, in order to type a new line without IPython executing the code straight away press <kbd>shift + Enter</kbd> you‚Äôll then need to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice again after the last line in the body of the if statement in order to execute it.</p>

<p>If you were to swap the ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù with a ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù in the example above what do you think would happen? Well nothing, actually, the computer would read ‚Äúif False‚Äù and decide not to execute the body and therefore not print anything to the screen.</p>

<p>This alone may seem pretty useless, how are you going to do anything with this since you already know the ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù or ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù value? The answer is that we don‚Äôt ever use True or False as the condition for an if statement, instead we use an expression that evaluates to either True or False. What does that mean? Well, if I were to tell you that 1 was equal to 2 you would tell me that I‚Äôm an idiot and that that‚Äôs totally wrong. Computers are beings of few words however and would simply reply with ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù, this in turn could be used in an if statement to find something out. That previous expression translated to Python would look like <code>1 == 2</code> which would evaluate to ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù, if we used that in conjunction with an if statement we could construct (the double equals means check if these two things are the same - if so replace the whole thing with True, if not False):</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>if 1 == 2:
    print("You have just broken maths")
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Again, notice that there‚Äôs no output here, 1 does not equal 2 therefore the expression <code>1 == 2</code> would evaluate to ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù and ‚Äúif False‚Äù never executes meaning the print statement isn‚Äôt executed either.</p>

<p>This same logic can be used when evaluating if one word is equal to another, in Python we represent a string (again, fancy programmer terminology for word/sentence) using quotes (can be either double quotes: ‚Äú‚Äù or single quotes: ‚Äò‚Äô that wrap the word/sentence we want to be the string ‚Äúlike this‚Äù or ‚Äòlike this‚Äô - both are valid). See example below:</p>

<div class="codeBlocksm">
<pre>
<code>if "this sentence/word" == "this sentence/word":
    print("This should print")
</code>
<samp>This should print</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Else</h4>

<p>One thing I haven‚Äôt touched on yet is the Else statement, this is only used in conjunction with If to allow the program to do one thing for one condition or do another thing if that condition ends up being False. If you don‚Äôt use an Else then the next line underneath the If statement will be executed whether the If statement evaluates to True or not. You can think of this as: IF something, do this, ELSE, do something else. You don‚Äôt need to use Else, if you don‚Äôt the computer will compute ‚ÄúIF something, do this‚Äù and only execute ‚Äúthis‚Äù if the ‚Äúsomething‚Äù turns out to be True, it will then read the next instruction on the next line beneath it. Maybe an example will clear this up:</p>

<div class="codeBlocksm">
<pre>
<code>if "this sentence/word" == "this sentence/word":
    print("This should print")

else:
    print("This should not print")

print("This should always print")
</code>
<samp>This should print</samp>
<samp>This should always print</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Putting it all together</h4>

<p>We can combine these types of ‚Äúthe same as‚Äù expressions with the formal logical operators we went over earlier. Since the expression <code>1 == 1</code> will be evaluated and seen by the computer as ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù and the expression <code>1 == 2</code> will be seen as ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù we can simply combine these with ease. For example we could use OR to combine those two expressions into one single expression (let‚Äôs say you wanted some code to be executed if either of two conditions were met). The way we would represent that is as follows:</p>

<div class="codeBlock">
<pre>
<code>if 1 == 1 OR 1 == 2:
    print("This should print")

else:
    print("This should not print")

print("This should always print")
</code>
<samp>This should print</samp>
<samp>This should always print</samp>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Remember, I am using capitalised ‚ÄúOR‚Äù here to make it obvious that it‚Äôs the operator not the word, when writing Python code you would simply write OR in the lower case. Be sure to experiment with these examples in <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" target="_blank">IPython</a> to help you fully grasp all these concepts.</p>

<p>This may seem difficult at first but it‚Äôs just got to click, keep at it and you‚Äôll do fine. Again, if I have overexplained or underexplained let me know, feedback is always welcome - email below :)</p>
