I"⁄<p>We live in a post-fact era, social media sites are full of misinformation and beliefs that often have very little evidential backing. This is somewhat benign when the things raised are of little impact to our lives (the belief in UFOs for example), however when this is not the case they can cause us to make very real decisions that have very real negative consequences. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the saying ‚Äúfaith is a virtue‚Äù is false and talk about better methods for seeking truth.</p>

<p>Before we begin we better get some definitions out of the way. Faith is simply belief without evidence, this means when somebody tells you that they believe something and then cannot point to a set of facts that support their claim that they are employing faith. The dictionary definition of faith is: ‚Äústrong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.‚Äù<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub> A virtue is generally something which has moral quality but can also be used to describe something useful. The dictionary definition of virtue is: ‚Äúa good or useful quality of a thing‚Äù<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub></p>

<p>Lets tackle the issue of faith being useful first. Utility can mean many things but for the sake of argument I will use the definition that aligns with progress</p>
