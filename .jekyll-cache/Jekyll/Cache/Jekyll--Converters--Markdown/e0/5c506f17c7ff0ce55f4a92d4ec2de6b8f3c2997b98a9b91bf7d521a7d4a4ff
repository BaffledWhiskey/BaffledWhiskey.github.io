I"N<p>We live in a post-fact era, social media sites are full of misinformation and beliefs that often have very little evidential backing. This is somewhat benign when the things raised are of little impact to our lives (the belief in UFOs for example), however when this is not the case they can cause us to make very real decisions that have very real negative consequences. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the saying ‚Äúfaith is a virtue‚Äù is false and talk about better methods for seeking truth.</p>

<p>Before we begin we better get some definitions out of the way. Faith is simply belief without evidence, this means when somebody tells you that they believe something and then cannot point to a set of facts that support their claim that they are employing faith. The dictionary definition of faith is: ‚Äústrong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.‚Äù<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub> A virtue is generally something which has moral quality but can also be used to describe something useful. The dictionary definition of virtue is: ‚Äúa good or useful quality of a thing‚Äù<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub></p>

<p>Lets tackle the issue of faith being useful first. Utility can mean many things, but for the sake of argument I will use the definition that aligns with progress to begin with. The main reason for human beings being the dominant species is due to our ability to create things with a useful function. Iterations of useful creations are what I will describe as progress, think of how we have made cars better over time for example, they have a longer range thus becoming more useful. Well how did we come to building and then iterating on the car? We used predictive models about the universe to come up with the idea of the internal combustion engine which enabled us (along with other impressive inventions) to build a car.</p>

<p>Notice how I said ‚Äúpredictive models about the universe‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfacts about the universe‚Äù. This is an important distinction since we don‚Äôt actually <i>know</i> how the universe works, we can however build models that describe it and predict outcomes given initial conditions. Gravity, for example, is one predictive model we have about the universe, it describes the apparent attraction between objects with mass. We can then use this model to predict things, such as the trajectory of a thrown ball for example. These models have utility, they enable us to do things that would seem like witchcraft to someone from a few hundred years ago.</p>

<p>So why is faith not useful in the same way? Well faith doesn‚Äôt predict anything, it doesn‚Äôt build predictive models and it doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to build cars. There‚Äôs a reason that technological progress has exploded since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" target="_blank">the Enlightenment</a>. Instead of relying on faith to tell us what to believe and how to think, we started employing the scientific method and reason to come to better conclusions. Some people may say that I have faith in science, this is incorrect, I have been provided with plenty of <i>evidence</i> that science works, planes don‚Äôt drop out of the sky, rockets put man on the moon, as Richard Dawkins once said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=O3v2m4_NHhA" target="_blank">‚Äúit works‚Ä¶ bitches‚Äù</a>.</p>

<p>Faith doesn‚Äôt cause progress. This is evident from the fact that if you go back 100 years and tell the average scientist a fraction of what we know today it would blow their mind, and probably lead to numerous early scientific breakthroughs. You do the same with religion and you wouldn‚Äôt surprise anybody, it hasn‚Äôt changed.</p>
