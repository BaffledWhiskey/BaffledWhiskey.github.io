I"9	<p>We live in a post-fact era, social media sites are full of misinformation and beliefs that often have very little evidential backing. This is somewhat benign when the things raised are of little impact to our lives (the belief in UFOs for example), however when this is not the case they can cause us to make very real decisions that have very real negative consequences. The aim of this article is to demonstrate that the saying “faith is a virtue” is false and talk about better methods for seeking truth.</p>

<p>Before we begin we better get some definitions out of the way. Faith is simply belief without evidence, this means when somebody tells you that they believe something and then cannot point to a set of facts that support their claim that they are employing faith. The dictionary definition of faith is: “strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.”<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub> A virtue is generally something which has moral quality but can also be used to describe something useful. The dictionary definition of virtue is: “a good or useful quality of a thing”<sub><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/" target="_blank">Oxford Languages</a></sub></p>

<p>Lets tackle the issue of faith being useful first. Utility can mean many things, but for the sake of argument I will use the definition that aligns with progress to begin with. The main reason for human beings being the dominant species is due to our ability to create things with a useful function. Iterations of useful creations are what I will describe as progress, think of how we have made cars better over time for example, they have a longer range thus becoming more useful. Well how did we come to building and then iterating on the car? We used predictive models about the universe to come up with the idea of the internal combustion engine which enabled us (along with other impressive inventions) to build a car.</p>

<p>Notice how I said “predictive models about the universe” rather than “facts about the universe”. This is an important distinction since we don’t actually <i>know</i> how the universe works, we can however build models that describe it and predict outcomes given initial conditions.</p>
