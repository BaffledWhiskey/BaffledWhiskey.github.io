I"‚<p>I think I speak for all Year Abroad students when I say that planning the Year Abroad this year has been about as stressful as it could possibly get. The pandemic along with the distant memory that is Brexit has created seemingly endless obstacles to getting abroad. I started searching for my work placement in Germany a year ago and only in late August this year did I have confirmation of when and where I would be and what I would be doing. Now, three weeks into my English Language Assistantship, I am still feeling the stress of COVID, even more than I am feeling the culture shock that our lecturers so frequently warned us of.</p>
