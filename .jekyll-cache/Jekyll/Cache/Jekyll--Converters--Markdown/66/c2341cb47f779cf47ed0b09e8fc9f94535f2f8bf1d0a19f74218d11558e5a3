I"<p>I think I speak for all Year Abroad students when I say that planning the Year Abroad this year has been about as stressful as it could possibly get. The pandemic along with the distant memory that is Brexit has created seemingly endless obstacles to getting abroad. I started searching for my work placement in Germany a year ago and only in late August this year did I have confirmation of when and where I would be and what I would be doing. Now, three weeks into my English Language Assistantship, I am still feeling the stress of COVID, even more than I am feeling the culture shock that our lecturers so frequently warned us of.</p>

<p>The ideal set up for a linguist living in their target language country is to live with native  speakers in order to be fully immersed in language and everyday life and culture. Despite  sending out message after message to potential flatmates, responses were sparse and  arrangements for virtual viewings never materialised. It’s unclear exactly why willing  flatmates were so difficult to come by but one can only speculate that who would want a  flatmate arriving from abroad in the current climate. Especially someone coming from a  country that is a fraction of the size but has twice the cases. As a result, I am now living  alone in a student apartment complex where communal spaces are hardly used and the only  interactions with my German neighbours are mumbling ‘Ciao’ to them as I leave the lift.  Don’t ask me why Germans use the Italian word for goodbye- I don’t understand either.</p>
