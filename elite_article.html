    <h3>
        Elite: Dangerous
        <small class="text-muted">The good, bad and the ugly</small>
    </h3>
    <div class="mainText">
    <p>Elite: Dangerous is a game loved by a few and misunderstood by many. The ratings of the game are generally a bit meh however this
        isn't the games fault. The reason for this is the fact the game is a simulator, these types of games are intended to be difficult
        in order to convince you that it could be feasible. Elite aims to convince you of its feasibility through complexity, this often puts
        new players off. Players come into the game expecting a "Star wars" esque experience where they can shoot their way out of most problems
        with what seems like relative ease - just watch the latest films...<br><br>
        This, however, is not what Elite is. It is brutally difficult at the beginning. Even undocking your sidewinder (the first ship most players
        start with) is a challenge in and of itself. Many blow themselves up a few times and quit at this point and thats ok. The reason for this is
        that without this difficulty the game would be unable to convince you that you are flying a complex spacecraft.<br><br>
        It is at this point where I expect many flight sim pilots to come out and say that flying is really not that hard given a few mins of practice.
        While this is true I expect many would get too frustrated to even bother, futhermore flying is only a small part of what it takes to become Elite.
